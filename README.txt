== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this an official Coin Hive plugin? =

We are in no way associated with the official Coin Hive website or developer. This is an unofficial plugin - we plan to pack it with features to bring the power of Coin Hive and Monero mining to WordPress admins. By providing a quick, easy experience for WordPress admins to join Coin Hive we hope to increase exposure to the original project.

= How can I notify my users that I’m using Coin Hive? =

We plan to add easy functionality shortly that will allow you to add a popup that informs the user that you are using Coin Hive and allows them to opt in to this functionality.

= Can I allow my users to switch Coin Hive ‘on’ and ‘off’? =

We will be adding a widget shortly that will allow you to give your users the functionality to decide if they want to run Coin Hive or not. Of course, this is an alternative setup - for best results, run the normal Coin Hive script.

= How can I trust that you aren’t skimming my hashrate? =

View the source, we only output a miner for your selected token. We are creating this plugin to make coin hive miner more accessible to the broader community not to make money.

= Can I change the Coin Hive settings from the plugin? =

At this stage only the target hashes setting can be manipulated, further options will be exposed in the coming week.

= How much can I make using the Coin Hive Ultimate plugin? =
This will depend on the total hash rate of your users as well as the options that your plugin is set to. Put simply, the more users, the longer they are visiting your site and the hash rate that you optimize for - all affect your earnings. We recommend testing to find the sweet spot.

= Are Coin Hive and Monero illegal? =

No.
